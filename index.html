        <h1>The History of the Typeface “Sans Serif”</h1>
        <h2>By Malory Prater</h2>
        
        <p>Many may not understand the difference of typefaces and all the different terms associated with them and how they change the appearance of the text. The name “sans serif” comes from the Roman typeface “serif” meaning line; and “sans”, as we all know, means without. First of all, let’s start by understanding what “serifs” are in the first place. Serifs are lines, or winged tips on the end of letters that you see in basic Roman serif fonts such as Times New Roman and Century Schoolbook. Some reasons for using serifs on letters back in the day were to clean up the lines made by the quill, as well as making it easier to read by helping the readers eye follow the line. The use of serifs in a typeface is thought to be more traditional and historical, while the sans serif suggests a more modern approach. In the transition between the more traditional serif fonts and the modern sans serifs, basic typefaces were considered to be simple and beautiful and appreciated for their clean look and efficiency for reading. The first use of the sans serif typeface was by an English architect named John Soane in a drawing he presented to the Royal academy in London. He inscribed some words on a building façade using the sans serif typeface for a British senate house he was designing. This was said to be the earliest example of the sans serif typeface known to the republican Rome.  After this introduction, the people began to use sans serif a lot for signs and typography, but it still wasn’t a widely known typeface. It is said that John Soane’s use of this typeface in his drawing was the origin for all of the sans serif typefaces of the 19th and 20th century. In 1816, William Caslon IV wrote a type sample book, creating a sans serif typeface called ‘Two Lines English Egyptian’. After that, the sans serif typeface became widely known and started to appear all over Europe and the US under the name “grotesque” and “sans serif”. </p>
        <p>Although the design and idea of the sans serif typefaces have been around since the time of ancient history, they were not really thoroughly pursued in the design industry until the 19th century. This new font style was not easily accepted right away due to the fact that people doubted its success in the industry because they believed that without the use of serifs, it would make it more difficult to keep the readers eye moving simply along the lines of the page resulting in the text being non legible. The sans serif typeface was created in order to have a more universal and legible style in all different sizes of type from large too small. The goal of sans serif was to bring something new and more legible to the print and design industry and was finally very successful in the 1990’s and has since been one of design’s strongest typography characteristic since. One of the most successful sans serif fonts was introduced by Swiss type face designer, Max Miedinger who designed the typeface Helvetica, but back then it was first named Neue Haas Grotesk. It wasn’t until 1961 that typeface maker Haas rebranded it as Helvetica and introduced to the wider world. Helvetica is a clean, no-nonsense typeface that is simple and straight to the point. Some places you might recognize this typeface being used is on the signage in New York’s subway system as well as the brand identity of American Airlines and American Apparel. This typeface will be around for a least a couple hundred years, “just like great architecture”. Designer Danny van den Dungen told the New York Times in 2007, when the Museum of Modern Art held a retrospective in honor of the typeface.</p>
        <p>Artist, Adrian Frutiger, also was one of the most successful sans serif designers as he has designed , Univers, Frutiger and Avenir- fonts in various families such as neogrotesque, humanist and geometric. And lastly, another artist to take note of when studying sans serif fonts, is artist Eric Gill. Gill introduced a series of German sans-serif families in a new "geometric" style, including fonts like  Erbar, Futura and Kabel. The history of these font families and the creators of them show the growth of fonts thereafter. </p>
        <p>Many might say that all sans serif fonts are the same however after looking at each font from a design standpoint there are many differences that make each font more favorable above another of similar appearance. The use of sans serif typefaces has become widely popular in the type and design industry and there are a large number of fonts under the sans serif umbrella that designers prefer. Some of these sans serif fonts are Apercu, Futura, Avenir, and Proxima nova. The Apercu typeface is a grotesque style type that was created in the United Kingdom in 2010 by an independent studio by the name of Colophon. It is known as one of the more distinguishable grotesque fonts and comes in light, regular, medium, and bold typestyles. Another popular font in the sans serif family is Futura which was released by the german type designer Paul Renner. released in 1927. It was and still is a very popular typeface because of its geometric design and has been very popular ever since its release. Futura is a typeface used for over 80 year-end is many designers favorite choice making it very popular in the modern era. The next most popular sans serif typeface of today is Avenir. Avenir was another geometric sans serif style typeface created by Adrian Frutiger in 1988. Avenir was modeled after Futura and was known to be one of Frutiger’s finest works with its humanistic features offered in many different styles. Another very popular typeface in the sans serif family is Proxima Nova. Proxima Nova was created by type designer Mark Simonson in 2005. Simonson’s typeface is a cross between Futura and Akzidenz Grotesk which resulted in a geometric but also modern appearing typeface. Proxima Nova is a very popular typeface so much so that some think it is often overused. There are literally tons of fonts in the sans serif category that all differ in appearance however some are more favorable by designers because of their unique characteristics and aesthetic purpose.</p>
